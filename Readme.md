### Programming in C- Lab Tets

## Task-01
You are required to build a system that is able to do simple
mathematical calculations. Create a C program that is able to compute the area of a
square, the area of a triangle and circle. The program should ask inputs from user to store the values and produce the outputs.


*Hint: area = (height x width)*
<b>Formula:</b> <i>area of triangle=1/2 x width x height; area of circle = 3.14 x radius x radius.</i>
