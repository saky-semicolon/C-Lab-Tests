### Programming in C- Lab Tests

## Task-01
You are required to build a system that is able to do simple
mathematical calculations. Create a C program that is able to compute the area of a
square, the area of a triangle and circle. The program should ask inputs from user to store the values and produce the outputs.


<b>Hint:</b> <i>area = (height x width)</i> <br>
<b>Formula:</b> <i>area of triangle=1/2 x width x height; area of circle = 3.14 x radius x radius.</i>

## Task-02
Create a C program that is able to calculate the speed travelled by a car,
time taken to reach the destination and distance travelled along the journey.


<b>Hint: </b> <i> speed = distance / time; time = distance / speed; distance = speed x time </i>
